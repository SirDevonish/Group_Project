# microcontroller-Based-Pulse-and-Glucose-Monitor
micro-controller Based Pulse and Glucose Monitor

Requirements
 When actively taking measurements:
Q1 The system has to measure a persons heart/pulse rate (in beats per minute), and estimate a
person's glucose level (in mg/dL). 8 marks
Q2 The system has to estimate EITHER heart rate variability using pNN50 (as a %) OR a person's
oxygen saturation level (as a %) 8 marks
Q3 The system has to measure the ambient temperature (in degrees Centigrade to +/- 0.1 degree
Centigrade) at which a reading is taken. 8 marks
Q4 The system should be capable of reporting all 4 (live) measurements on the LCD display. 8 marks
Q5 All sensors/system measurements should be calibrated and/or the error quantied. 8 marks
Q6 The system should provide audible warnings if the (live) measurements fall outside of acceptable
range for pulse rate, glucose level, and heart rate variability/oxygen saturation (allowing for
the sensor/system resolution/accuracy error). 8 marks
Q7 The system should allow a user to start storing a pre-dened set of measurements to external

ash RAM, and to interrupt the ongoing storage of a set of measurements. 8 marks
 When not actively taking measurements:
Q8 the system should allow the user to scroll through ALL measurements stored on external 
ash
RAM. 8 marks
 At any time:
Q9 the system should allow a user to specify intervals at which readings should be stored to
external 
ash RAM, and the number of measurements to be stored. 8 marks
Q0 The system should tolerate a power/brown-out reset without corrupting information/display.
